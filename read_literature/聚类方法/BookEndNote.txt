%X This paper proposes a data-driven diagnostic approach for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) systems. Fault detection and isolation (FDI) is realized by analyzing individual cell voltages. A feature extraction method Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) and a multi-class classification method Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machine (DAGSVM) are utilized successively to extract the useful features from raw data and classify the extracted features into various classes related to health states. Experimental data of two different stacks are used to validate the proposed approach. The results show that five concerned faults can be detected and isolated with a high accuracy. Moreover, the light computational cost of the approach enhances the possibility of its online implementation.

%X To improve the performance and lifetime of the low temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack, water management is an important issue. This paper aims at developing an online diagnostic methodology with the capability of discriminating different degrees of flooding/drying inside the fuel cell stack. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is utilized as a basis tool and a double-fuzzy method consisting of fuzzy clustering and fuzzy logic is developed to mine diagnostic rules from the experimental data automatically. Through online experimental verification, a high interpretability and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology can be achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

%X This paper is dedicated to data-driven diagnosis for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). More precisely, it deals with water related faults (flooding and membrane drying) by using pattern classification methodologies. Firstly, a method based on physical considerations is defined to label the training data. Secondly, a feature extraction procedure is carried out to pick up the significant features from vectors constructed by individual cell voltages. Finally, a classification is adopted in the feature space to realize the fault diagnosis. Various feature extraction and classification methodologies are employed on a 20-cell PEMFC stack. The performances of these methodologies are compared.
